Examples
========

The detailed feature lists have examples that work using a header file, and
there is the `tutorial`_ that shows mixing of C++ and Python interactively.
More complete examples that show packaging include these repos (in
alphabetical order):

 * `cppyy-bbhash`_
 * `cppyy-knearestneighbors`_
 * `python-vspline`_

In addition, cppyy is being re-integrated in it's roots, which includes
several sophisticated pythonizations.
See the "experimental" version of the `PyROOT`_ project.
